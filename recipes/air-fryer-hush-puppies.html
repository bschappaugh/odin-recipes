    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</p>
    <!--Ingredients-->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonfat cooking spray</li>
